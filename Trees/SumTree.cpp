//Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree
//where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree.
//An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.
