//Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands.
//
//A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
//
//{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
//{0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
//{1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
//{0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
//{1, 0, 1, 0, 1}
//A cell in 2D matrix can be connected to 8 neighbors.
